Version 6.1 to 6.2

Added Motion Compensated Prediction with 1/8-pel MV-resolution:
- New Parameter in CFG-file to switch between 1/4- and 1/8-pel
- New interplation filter for 1/8-pel MV-resolution added.
  a) reference frames are sampled up and stpred by a factor of 4 (1/4-pel resolution)
  b) 1/8-pel postitions are calculated on the fly by bilinear interolation
  c) all chroma values are interpolated with a bilinear filter
  d) items b) and c) lead to a slightly reduced gain compared to implementation
     in M20, but still a gain up to 1.0 dB is obtained comared to TML591. 
	 Thus, further improvements are possible.

Remarks:
- Seams to be a bug in the direct-Bframe-mode at least in Version 6.1 and 6.2.

Remarks from Version 6.1:
- Decoder still missing, HHI is working on it, will be added in later release
- Command line parameter option may still contain bugs.  (Now fixed, should work fine).
- Will need to replace the variable name stat one day, because stat() is a UNIX
  syscall which results in many warnings on a cary and on gcc -pedantic
