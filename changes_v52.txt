Changes from version 5.1 to version 5.2

-Important:
	This version of TML5 adopts a data-partitioner in the encoder but 
	no "real" data departitioner within the decoder.
	As outlined in document Q15-K-16 the Network-Application-Layer might
	take control of merging partitions into one network-packet. Due to 
	the characteristics of the used VLC-coding the data departitioner of 
	Q15-K-16 takes care of seperating the partitions by parsing and 
	interpretation of the incoming bitstream. This feature is NOT 
	implemented here, as it requires additional parsing. Therefore we 
	made use of an external data partitioning file written by the encoder 
	which has the same filename as the encoded H.26L video stream with an 
	additional extension of ".dp". This file caintains the partitionnumber 
	(to assign partition to its containing syntaxelement types)	and its 
	length in bits in consecutive lines. This information provided now by 
	this file would also be available by parsing the partitioned bitstream 
	with Q15-K-16, but makes the decoding process fairly easier. 

-Encoder:
	Encoder writes data partition syntax to file with extension ".dp" 
		
-Decoder:
	implements error concealment in accordance to the different syntax 
	element types. The scheme follows the proposed error concealment of 
	Q15-J-23

-Assignment of element types to partition:
	is possible now with assignSE2partition-Array in elements.h both
	in the encoder as in the decoder. 
	
-NAL-modes:
	The different NAL-modes to be specified are now as follows:
	0	conventional H.26L bitstream
	1	all elements are joined in one partition 
		(conventional H.26L bitstream with frame/slicewise packetization)
	2	H.223 partition scheme as proposed in Q15-J-23
	3	Internet partitioning scheme as proposed in Q15-J-53

-NAL4H223:
	For use of the TML5 with the pseudomux-tool from Q15-K-15 a NAL 
	encoder and	decoder for H.223 Annex B/D is available in the directory 
	NAL4H223. 
	This tool adapts the TML 5 interim file format to the pseudomux format.
