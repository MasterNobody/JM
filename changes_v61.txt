Version 6.0 to 6.1


- New Picture Header somewhat according to VCEG-M79.  A more precise version
  of VCEG-M79 will be released shortly to document the implementation
- Added new Picture Start Code, UVLC codeword len=31, info=0.  Parameters
  are following as described in VCEG-M79
- Slice Headers changed to three UVLC codewords:
    - one len=31, value=1
    - two parameters, UVLC coded, (31-Quant) and (FirstMbInSlice)
- Removed all local reference to variables img, inp, stat, snr.  Use globals
  instead.
- Some optimizations in block.c to make snr and hadmard calculation more
  cache-friendly
- Fast ByteAbs() to replace absm for snr calculation.  For hadamard, need
  to enhance value range (how far?).  This ByteAbs leads to very slow
  debug-code and rather fast release-code.
- Mini Sequence Header added, along with provisions for easy enhancements of new
  sequence header formats
- New Input file with new syntax.  See inline comments in configfile.h and the
  sample configfile ./bin/encoder.cfg.
- Compiles now with gcc in Sun and CYGWIN environments, and on a Cray using the
  Cary gcc port.  Only a few #ifdefs for variable declarations were needed.
- gcc Makefile available in ./lencod.  Please add your own .o files if you 
  add new .c modules here (in addition to the MS-Project file).

Remarks:
- Decoder still missing, HHI is working on it, will be added in later release
- Command line parameter option may still contain bugs.  (Now fixed, should work fine).
- Will need to replace the variable name stat one day, because stat() is a UNIX
  syscall which results in many warnings on a cary and on gcc -pedantic
