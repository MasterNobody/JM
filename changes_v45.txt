Version 4.5 differs from 4.5 functionally by the implementation of the data
partitioning syntax.  A corresponding textual description will be available
shortly, as will be a more verbose update of this file.

The function-pointer interface for the NAL as discussed in the changes_44.txt file
was employed to enable data partitioning.  Therefore, it is now possible to
set this variable in the config files to 1.

Known bug: the decoder does not decode the last picture.  Will be fixed shortly.

DP was tested with and without slices and seems to work without problems.

The other major difference is the clean-up in the file structure.  In particular:

- stream.c implements only symbol buffering and convert between VLC and len/info tupels.
- nal_bits.c implements the bitstream
_ nal_part.c implements the data partitioning file
