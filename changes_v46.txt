Version 4.6 differs from 4.5 functionally by the extension of the data
partitioning syntax.  Additionaly the decoder was extended by a simple error concealment.

Note: Syntax elements within partitions containing more than one syntax element are not ordered inside this partition.


Known bug: the decoder does not decode the last picture.  Will be fixed as outlined in Version 4.5 shortly.

DP was tested with and without slices and seems to work without problems.

The other major difference in the file structure.  In particular:

Encoder and Decoder:

- elements.h		assignment of syntax element to partition.
		
Decoder

- errorconcealment.c	functions to allow a simple error concealment. 
			No tested with corrupted H.26L bitstreams yet.
